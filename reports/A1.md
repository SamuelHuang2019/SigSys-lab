### Basic Problem a

The system $y[n] = \sin((\pi/2)x[n]$ is not linear. Use the signals $x_1[n] = \delta[n]$ and $x_2[n] = 2\delta[n]$ to demonstrate how the system violates linearity.

The MATLAB script is shown in the following code block.

```matlab
% define scopes
l = 5;

% Basic Problem a
n = [-l:l];
x1 = [zeros(1, l) 1 zeros(1, l)];
x2 = 2 * x1;
x3 = x1 + x2;

y1 = L(x1);
y2 = L(x2);
y3 = y1 + y2
y4 = L(x3)

stem(n, y3, 'o')
hold on
stem(n, y4, '*')

title('y[n] = sin((pi/2)x[n])')
xlabel('Time');
ylabel('Output')
legend('y_1[n] = sin((pi/2)x_1[n]) + sin((pi/2)x_2[n])', ...
    'y_2[n] = sin((pi/2)(x_1[n]+x_2[n]))');

% define system
function y = L(x)
    y = sin(pi / 2 * x)
end
```

The plot is shown below.

Apparently, $y_1[n] = \sin{\left\{(\pi/2)x_1[n]\right\}} + \sin{\left\{(\pi/2)x_2[n]\right\}}$ is not identical with $y_2[n] = \sin{\left\{(\pi/2)(x_1[n] + x_2[n])\right\}}$, hence the system is not linear.

### Basic Problem b

The system $y[n] = x[n] + x[n + 1]$ is not causal. Use the signal $x[n] = u[n]$ to demonstrate this. Define the MATLAB vectors x and y to represent the input on the interval $-5 \le n \le 9$, and the output on the interval $-6 \le n \le 9$, respectively.

The MATLAB script is shown in the following code block.

```matlab
%Basic Problem b
n = [-6 : 9];
x = [zeros(1, 6) 1/2 ones(1, 9) ]
x0 = [zeros(1, 6) 1/2 ones(1, 9)];
x1 = [zeros(1, 5) 1/2 ones(1, 10)];
y = x0 + x1;

stem(n, x, '*');
stem(n, y);
```

The plot is shown below.

![Figure a](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamuelHuang2019/SigSys-lab/master/figures/A1_b.png)

The excitation starts at time $n=0$, however, before that at time $n=-1$, the output $y[n]$ is non-zero. Hence, the system is not causal.

### Intermediate Problem c

The MATLAB script is shown in the following code block.

```matlab
n = [-1 : 0.001 : 1];
x = n.^2;
y = log(x);
plot(n,y,'*')
```

The output in the terminal is

```matlab
>> run("c:\Users\Guanc\Documents\GitHub\SigSys-lab\src\A1\A1_c.m")

...

Columns 97 through 112

   -6.4378   -7.0131   -7.8240   -9.2103      -Inf   -9.2103   -7.8240   -7.0131   -6.4378   -5.9915   -5.6268   -5.3185   -5.0515   -4.8159   -4.6052   -4.4145

...

>>
```

In which there is `-Inf` output.

The plot is shown below.

![Figure a](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamuelHuang2019/SigSys-lab/master/figures/A1_c.png)

The system is not stable, because when we give a bounded input the output approaches infinity at time $n = 0$, which contradicts the definition of stability.

### Advanced Problems e, f, g

For each of the following systems, state whether or not the system is linear, time-invariant, causal, stable, and invertible. For each property you claim the system does not possess, construct a counter-argument using MATLAB to demonstrate how the system violates the property in question.

(e). $y[n] = x^3[n]$.

Define input signal to be $x[n] = n$, the crucial part of MATLAB script is shown below.

```matlab
% define scope
l = 5;

% 1.4 Advanced Problem e
n = [-l:l];
x = n;

y1 = L(x);
y2 = L(x + x)
y3 = y1 + y1

stem(n, y1);
hold on
stem(n, y2);
hold on
stem(n, y3);

% define system
function y = L(x)
    y = x.^3;
end
```

According to the plot, $2x^3[n]\ne(2x[n])^3$, hence the system is nonlinear.

![Figure 1.4-e](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamuelHuang2019/SigSys-lab/master/figures/A1_e.png)

The system is time-invariant, causal, stable and invertible.

---

(g). $y[n] = x[2n]$.

Define input signal $x[n] = n^2$, the MATLAB script is shown in the code block below.

```matlab
% define scope
l = 10;

% 1.4 advanced problem g
% time-invariance

n = [-l:l]
t = 2
y1 = L(n)
nt = n - t;
y2 = [zeros(1:t) y1(1, t + 1:2 * l + 1)]
y3 = L(nt)


stem(n, y1, '*');
hold on
stem(n, y2);
hold on
stem(n, y3, '*');

...

%def function
function y = L(x)
    y = x.^2
end
```

![Figure 1.4-g-1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamuelHuang2019/SigSys-lab/master/figures/A1_g_1.png)

According to the figure, $y_2[n] = x[2n - t]$ is not identical with $y_3[n] = y_1[n-t] = x[2(n - t)]$, hence the system is time-variant.

Define input signal $x[n] = \delta[n - 1]$, the MATLAB script is shown in the code block below.

```matlab
l = 4;
n = [-l:l];
% define unit impulse input at n = 2
x1 = [zeros(1, l + 2) 1 zeros(1, l - 2)]

nt = 1:2:2 * l + 1
y4 = [zeros(1, l / 2) x1(nt) zeros(1, l / 2)]

stem(n, x1, '*')
hold on
stem(n, y4)
```

![Figure 1.4-g-2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamuelHuang2019/SigSys-lab/master/figures/A1_g_2.png)

According to the figure the impulse input is at time $n = 2$, however, there is response at time $n = 1$, hence the system is not causal.

The system is linear,
