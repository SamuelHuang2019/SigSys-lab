> In the following tests, we used the first speech signal, namely `C_01_01.wav` as material.

## Part 1

The power spectrum of the speech signal is shown in the figure below.

![Figure 5-1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamuelHuang2019/SigSys-lab/master/figures/A5_1.png)

The length of the noise should correspond to that of the speech signal.

The MATLAB script is shown in the code block below.

```matlab
close all
[y, fs] = audioread('C_01_01.wav');
sig = repmat(y, 5, 1);
[Pxx, w] = periodogram(sig, [], 512, fs);

plot(w, Pxx)
title('power spectrum density of the speech signal')
xlabel('frequency')
ylabel('power spectral density')

b = fir2(3000, w / (fs / 2), sqrt(Pxx / max(Pxx)));
[N, ~] = size(sig);
noise = 1 - 2 * rand(N, 1);
ssn = filter(b, 1, noise);
```

## Part 2

To set the SNR to be $-5$, assuming the coefficient of `sig` is $1$, and that of `ssn` is $a$, according to the property of `norm()`, we have

$$
\text{SNR} =
20\lg\frac{\text{norm}(\text{sig})}
{\text{norm}(a\,\text{ssn})} =
-5 \Rightarrow
a =
\frac{\text{norm}(\text{sig})}
{\text{norm}(\text{ssn})}10^{1/4}.
$$

To verify this, try running

```matlab
snr = 20 * log10(norm(sig) / norm(ssn * norm(sig) / norm(ssn) * 10^(1/4)))
```

The output is exactly

```matlab
snr =
    -5
```

To adjust the intensity, run

```matlab
y = y / norm(y) * norm(sig);
norm(sig)
norm(y)
```

The output is again exactly

```matlab
ans =
   27.6355

ans =
   27.6355
```

Therefore, the norm, as well as the energy in signal `sig` and `y` is identical.

## Part 3

Firstly, do full wave rectification with running

```matlab
y = abs(y);
```

Then, generate and apply 2-nd order low-pass Butterworth filter of different cutoff frequency.

```matlab
[b, a] = butter(2, 100 / (fs / 2));
env = filter(b, a, y);
subplot(3, 1, 1)
plot(env)
title('f_{cut} = 100Hz')
hold on

[b, a] = butter(2, 200 / (fs / 2));
env = filter(b, a, y);
subplot(3, 1, 2)
plot(env)
title('f_{cut} = 200Hz')
hold on

[b, a] = butter(2, 300 / (fs / 2));
subplot(3, 1, 3)
env = filter(b, a, y);
plot(env)
title('f_{cut} = 300Hz')
```

The figure is shown below.

According to the waveform, it is apparently that the higher the cutoff frequency is, the "denser" the waveform of envelope extracted obtained.

Again, try low-pass Butterworth filter with 6th-order.

```matlab
[b, a] = butter(2, 200 / (fs / 2));
env = filter(b, a, y);
subplot(2, 1, 1)
plot(env)
title('2nd-order')
hold on

[b, a] = butter(6, 200 / (fs / 2));
env = filter(b, a, y);
subplot(2, 1, 2)
plot(env)
title('6th-order')
```

The figure is shown below.

![Figure 5-3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamuelHuang2019/SigSys-lab/master/figures/A5_3.png)

Compared with that of the 2nd-order filter, the wave form of envelope extracted using 6th-order filter is even sharper, thus has better performance.
