> In the following tests, we used the first speech signal, namely `C_01_01.wav` as material.

## Part 1

The power spectrum of the speech signal is shown in the figure below.

![Figure 5-1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamuelHuang2019/SigSys-lab/master/figures/A5_1.png)

The length of the noise should correspond to that of the speech signal.

The MATLAB script is shown in the code block below.

```matlab
close all
[y, fs] = audioread('C_01_01.wav');
sig = repmat(y, 5, 1);
[Pxx, w] = periodogram(sig, [], 512, fs);

plot(w, Pxx)
title('power spectrum density of the speech signal')
xlabel('frequency')
ylabel('power spectral density')

b = fir2(3000, w / (fs / 2), sqrt(Pxx / max(Pxx)));
[N, ~] = size(sig);
noise = 1 - 2 * rand(N, 1);
ssn = filter(b, 1, noise);
```
