### Intermediate Problems a

For this problem, we can find out the vector easily. Notice that the two systems are all DT systems, so the order for index should be $[a_0,a_1,...,a_k]$, and $a_1$ and $a_2$ should be the index vectors for outputs while $b_1$ and $b_2$ is for inputs.

The MATLAB script is shown below.

```matlab
% System1
a1 = [1 -0.8];
b1 = 1;

% System2
a2 = [1 0.8];
b2 = 1;
```

### Intermediate Problem b

In this problem we need yo find out the frequency response for the two systems. To do this we need to use the function `freqz()`. All we need to do is to check the index vectors we need to use and the number of points we want to collect. The index vectors have already been found out in problem a and the number of points has been mentioned in the question stem, which is 1024. Then we can easily plot the plots.

The plots are shown below.

The MATLAB script is shown below.

```matlab
% System1
a1 = [1 -0.8];
b1 = 1;

% System2
a2 = [1 0.8];
b2 = 1;

N = 1024;
[H1, omega1] = freqz(b1, a1, N, 'whole');
[H2, omega2] = freqz(b2, a2, N, 'whole');

% Plot the plots
subplot(2, 1, 1)
plot(omega1, abs(H1))
xlabel ('\omega1')
ylabel('H(e^{j\omega})')
title('System1')

subplot(2, 1, 2)
plot(omega2, abs(H2))
xlabel ('\omega2')
ylabel('H(e^{j\omega})')
title('System2')
```

## 3.9

### Intermediate Problem a

This problem needs us to find the output of a system whose frequency response and input are given. Because the frequency response, in other words the system function, is $H(s) = { 1\over 1+RCs}$ and $RC = 1$, the index vector for input is `b = [1 0]`, for output is `a = [1 1]`. The input signal is $x(t) = cos(t)$ and the region for $t$ is $0 \leq t \leq 20$, so now we have figure out all the parameters need for calculating the output.

Now we use function `lsim()` to calculate the output.

The plot is shown below.

![Figure 3.9-a](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamuelHuang2019/SigSys-lab/master/figures/A3_3-9_a.png)

The MATLAB script is shown below.

```matlab
t = linspace(0, 20, 1000);
x = cos(t);
b = [1 0];
a = [1 1];

y = lsim(b, a, x, t);

plot(t, y)
xlim([10 20])
hold on
plot(t, x)
xlim([10 20])
xlabel('t')
ylabel('Output')
title('Response of H to x')
legend('y', 'x');
```

### Intermediate Problem b

This problem needs us to find the output for the same system but change the input into a square wave `x2`. 

The way to produce a square wave has been given in the question stem and is shown below.

```matlab
>> x2 = cos(t);
>> x2(x2 > 0) = ones(size(x2(x2 > 0)));
>> 2(x2 < 0) = -ones(size(x2(x2 < 0)));
```

Now we can use the same way to find out the output as in problem a.

The plot is shown below.

![Figure 3.9-b](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamuelHuang2019/SigSys-lab/master/figures/A3_3-9_b.png)

The MATLAB script is shown below.

```matlab
t = linspace(0, 20, 1000);

% square wave
x2 = cos(t);
x2(x2 > 0) = ones(size(x2(x2 > 0)));
x2(x2 < 0) = -ones(size(x2(x2 < 0)));

b = [1 0];
a = [1 1];
y2 = lsim(b, a, x2, t);

plot(t, y2)
xlim([10 20])
xlabel('t')
ylabel('Output')
title('Response of H to x2')
```
