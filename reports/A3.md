## 3.8

### Intermediate Problems a

For this problem, we can find out the vector easily. Notice that the two systems are all DT systems, so the order for index should be $[a_0,a_1,...,a_k]$, and $a_1$ and $a_2$ should be the index vectors for outputs while $b_1$ and $b_2$ is for inputs.

The MATLAB script is shown below.

```matlab
% System1
a1 = [1 -0.8];
b1 = 1;

% System2
a2 = [1 0.8];
b2 = 1;
```

### Intermediate Problem b

In this problem we need yo find out the frequency response for the two systems. To do this we need to use the function `freqz()`. All we need to do is to check the index vectors we need to use and the number of points we want to collect. The index vectors have already been found out in problem a and the number of points has been mentioned in the question stem, which is 1024. Then we can easily plot the plots.

The plots are shown below.

The MATLAB script is shown below.

```matlab
% System1
a1 = [1 -0.8];
b1 = 1;

% System2
a2 = [1 0.8];
b2 = 1;

N = 1024;
[H1, omega1] = freqz(b1, a1, N, 'whole');
[H2, omega2] = freqz(b2, a2, N, 'whole');

% Plot the plots
subplot(2, 1, 1)
plot(omega1, abs(H1))
xlabel ('\omega1')
ylabel('H(e^{j\omega})')
title('System1')

subplot(2, 1, 2)
plot(omega2, abs(H2))
xlabel ('\omega2')
ylabel('H(e^{j\omega})')
title('System2')
```
