## 3.8

### Intermediate Problems a

For this problem, we can find out the vector easily. Notice that the two systems are all DT systems, so the order for index should be $[a_0,a_1,...,a_k]$, and $a_1$ and $a_2$ should be the index vectors for outputs while $b_1$ and $b_2$ is for inputs.

The MATLAB script is shown below.

```matlab
% System1
a1 = [1 -0.8];
b1 = 1;

% System2
a2 = [1 0.8];
b2 = 1;
```

---

### Intermediate Problem b

In this problem we need yo find out the frequency response for the two systems. To do this we need to use the function `freqz()`. All we need to do is to check the index vectors we need to use and the number of points we want to collect. The index vectors have already been found out in problem a and the number of points has been mentioned in the question stem, which is 1024. Then we can easily plot the plots.

The plots are shown below.

The MATLAB script is shown below.

```matlab
% System1
a1 = [1 -0.8];
b1 = 1;

% System2
a2 = [1 0.8];
b2 = 1;

N = 1024;
[H1, omega1] = freqz(b1, a1, N, 'whole');
[H2, omega2] = freqz(b2, a2, N, 'whole');

% Plot the plots
subplot(2, 1, 1)
plot(omega1, abs(H1))
xlabel ('\omega1')
ylabel('H(e^{j\omega})')
title('System1')

subplot(2, 1, 2)
plot(omega2, abs(H2))
xlabel ('\omega2')
ylabel('H(e^{j\omega})')

```

## 3.9

### Intermediate Problem a

This problem needs us to find the output of a system whose frequency response and input are given. Because the frequency response, in other words the system function, is $H(s) = { 1\over 1+RCs}$ and $RC = 1$, the index vector for input is `b = [1 0]`, for output is `a = [1 1]`. The input signal is $x(t) = cos(t)$ and the region for $t$ is $0 \leq t \leq 20$, so now we have figure out all the parameters need for calculating the output.

Now we use function `lsim()` to calculate the output.

The plot is shown below.

![Figure 3.9-a](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamuelHuang2019/SigSys-lab/master/figures/A3_3-9_a.png)

We can see that the amplitude and phase for $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ are different. The reason can be found in $H(s) = { 1\over 1+RCs}$, from which we can notice $y(t) + {dy(t)\over dx(t)} = x(t)$. Using mathematical method we can figure out that $y(t) = {cos(t)+sin(t)\over 2}$, which can also be written as $y(t) = {\sqrt[]{2}\over 2}cos(t-{\pi\over 4})$. So in this form of $y(t)$ we can easily figure out the difference in amplitude and phase.

The MATLAB script is shown below.

```matlab
t = linspace(0, 20, 1000);
x = cos(t);
b = [1 0];
a = [1 1];

y = lsim(b, a, x, t);

plot(t, y)
xlim([10 20])
hold on
plot(t, x)
xlim([10 20])
xlabel('t')
ylabel('Output')
title('Response of H to x')
legend('y', 'x');
```

### Intermediate Problem b

This problem needs us to find the output for the same system but change the input into a square wave `x2`. 

The way to produce a square wave has been given in the question stem and is shown below.

```matlab
>> x2 = cos(t);
>> x2(x2 > 0) = ones(size(x2(x2 > 0)));
>> 2(x2 < 0) = -ones(size(x2(x2 < 0)));
```

Now we can use the same way to find out the output as in problem a.

The plot is shown below.

![Figure 3.9-b](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamuelHuang2019/SigSys-lab/master/figures/A3_3-9_b.png)

The MATLAB script is shown below.

```matlab
t = linspace(0, 20, 1000);

% square wave
x2 = cos(t);
x2(x2 > 0) = ones(size(x2(x2 > 0)));
x2(x2 < 0) = -ones(size(x2(x2 < 0)));

b = [1 0];
a = [1 1];
y2 = lsim(b, a, x2, t);

plot(t, y2)
xlim([10 20])
xlabel('t')
ylabel('Output')
title('Response of H to x2')
```

### Advanced Problem c

The question need us to simulate x2 using the first ten nonzero numbers of the CTFS coefficients. Because we have already noticed $x(t)$, now we calculate the coefficients using mathematical method. Then we place the positive coefficients in vector `apos_k` and the negative coefficients in vector `aneg_k`. After that we create the harmonic components using the method given by the question stem.

So we have five harmonic components as shown below.

```matlab
s1 = apos_k(1) * exp(j * t) + aneg_k(1) * exp(-j * t);
s2 = apos_k(2) * exp(j * 2 * t) + aneg_k(2) * exp(-j * 2 * t);
s3 = apos_k(3) * exp(j * 3 * t) + aneg_k(3) * exp(-j * 3 * t);
s4 = apos_k(4) * exp(j * 4 * t) + aneg_k(4) * exp(-j * 4 * t);
s5 = apos_k(5) * exp(j * 5 * t) + aneg_k(5) * exp(-j * 5 * t);
```

Then we sum them up to get the simulation results for x2.

The plot is shown below.

![Figure 3.9-c](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamuelHuang2019/SigSys-lab/master/figures/A3_3-9_c.png)

The MATLAB script is shown below.

```matlab
t = linspace(0, 20, 1000);

% square wave
x2 = cos(t);
x2(x2 > 0) = ones(size(x2(x2 > 0)));
x2(x2 < 0) = -ones(size(x2(x2 < 0)));

% coefficients for x2 CTFS
apos_k = 2 * [sin(pi / 2) / pi, sin(pi) / (2 * pi), sin(pi * 3/2) / (3 * pi), sin(2 * pi) / (4 * pi), sin(pi * 5/2) / (5 * pi)];
aneg_k = 2 * [sin(-pi / 2) / (-pi), sin(-pi) / (-2 * pi), sin(-pi * 3/2) / (-3 * pi), sin(-2 * pi) / (-4 * pi), sin(-pi * 5/2) / (-5 * pi)];

s1 = apos_k(1) * exp(j * t) + aneg_k(1) * exp(-j * t);
s2 = apos_k(2) * exp(j * 2 * t) + aneg_k(2) * exp(-j * 2 * t);
s3 = apos_k(3) * exp(j * 3 * t) + aneg_k(3) * exp(-j * 3 * t);
s4 = apos_k(4) * exp(j * 4 * t) + aneg_k(4) * exp(-j * 4 * t);
s5 = apos_k(5) * exp(j * 5 * t) + aneg_k(5) * exp(-j * 5 * t);
s = real(s1 + s2 + s3 + s4 + s5);

% plot
plot(t, x2)
hold on
plot(t, s)
xlabel('t')
ylabel('Output')
title('Simulation For x2')
legend('x2', 's')
```

### Advanced Problem d

This question need us to find out the response for `s1`,`s2`,`s3`,`s4`,`s5` and `ssum`, and in problem c we have already find out those inputs. And because the $H(s)$ hasn't changed, the two index vectors `a` and `b` wil be the same as problem a. Then, we use the function `lsim()` to produce Outputs.

The plot is shown below.

![Figure 3.9-d](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamuelHuang2019/SigSys-lab/master/figures/A3_3-9_d.png)

The MATLAB script is shown below.

```matlab
t = linspace(0, 20, 1000);

% coefficients for x2 CTFS
apos_k = 2 * [sin(pi / 2) / pi, sin(pi) / (2 * pi), sin(pi * 3/2) / (3 * pi), sin(2 * pi) / (4 * pi), sin(pi * 5/2) / (5 * pi)];
aneg_k = 2 * [sin(-pi / 2) / (-pi), sin(-pi) / (-2 * pi), sin(-pi * 3/2) / (-3 * pi), sin(-2 * pi) / (-4 * pi), sin(-pi * 5/2) / (-5 * pi)];

s1 = apos_k(1) * exp(j * t) + aneg_k(1) * exp(-j * t);
s2 = apos_k(2) * exp(j * 2 * t) + aneg_k(2) * exp(-j * 2 * t);
s3 = apos_k(3) * exp(j * 3 * t) + aneg_k(3) * exp(-j * 3 * t);
s4 = apos_k(4) * exp(j * 4 * t) + aneg_k(4) * exp(-j * 4 * t);
s5 = apos_k(5) * exp(j * 5 * t) + aneg_k(5) * exp(-j * 5 * t);
ssum = real(s1 + s2 + s3 + s4 + s5);

% Output 
b = [1 0];
a = [1 1];

y1 = lsim(b, a, s1, t);
y2 = lsim(b, a, s2, t);
y3 = lsim(b, a, s3, t);
y4 = lsim(b, a, s4, t);
y5 = lsim(b, a, s5, t);
ysum = lsim(b, a, ssum, t);

% plot
plot(t, ysum)
xlabel('t')
ylabel('Output')
title('Response for ssum')
```

### Advanced Problem e

We first place the original output and the simulation output together to make a comparison.  

The plot for two output and the energy for `x2` is shown below.

![Figure 3.9-e](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamuelHuang2019/SigSys-lab/master/figures/A3_3-9_e.png)

We can easily conclude from the plots that the two response are similar, the reason can be figure out in the second plot that the energy for `x2` is mostly determined by the low frequency part, which is the part we choose to use for simulation.

The MATLAB script is shown below.

```matlab
t = linspace(0, 20, 1000);
x = cos(t);
b = 1;
a = [1 1];

% coefficients for x2 CTFS
apos_k = 2 * [sin(pi / 2) / pi, sin(pi) / (2 * pi), sin(pi * 3/2) / (3 * pi), sin(2 * pi) / (4 * pi), sin(pi * 5/2) / (5 * pi)];
aneg_k = 2 * [sin(-pi / 2) / (-pi), sin(-pi) / (-2 * pi), sin(-pi * 3/2) / (-3 * pi), sin(-2 * pi) / (-4 * pi), sin(-pi * 5/2) / (-5 * pi)];

s1 = apos_k(1) * exp(j * t) + aneg_k(1) * exp(-j * t);
s2 = apos_k(2) * exp(j * 2 * t) + aneg_k(2) * exp(-j * 2 * t);
s3 = apos_k(3) * exp(j * 3 * t) + aneg_k(3) * exp(-j * 3 * t);
s4 = apos_k(4) * exp(j * 4 * t) + aneg_k(4) * exp(-j * 4 * t);
s5 = apos_k(5) * exp(j * 5 * t) + aneg_k(5) * exp(-j * 5 * t);
ssum = real(s1 + s2 + s3 + s4 + s5);

% The two outputs
ysum = lsim(b, a, ssum, t);
y = lsim(b, a, x, t);

%plot
subplot(2, 1, 1), plot(t, y)
hold on
plot(t, ysum)
xlabel('t')
ylabel('Output')

legend('Original Output', 'Harmonic Components Sum')

% energy
k = 1000;
E = zeros(1, 1000);
e = 0;

for i = 1:k
    e = e + (sin(i * pi / 2) / i * pi)^2 + (sin(i * (-pi) / 2) / i * (-pi))^2
    E(i) = e;
end

subplot(2, 1, 2)
plot(t, E)
