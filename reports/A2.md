### Basic Problem a 

The plots of x1[n],h1[n] and h2[n] are shown below.


The MATLAB script is shown below.

```matlab
nx1 = 0:9;
nh1 = 0:4;
x1 = [ones(1, 5) zeros(1, 5)];
h1 = [1 -1 3 0 1];
h2 = [0 2 5 4 -1];

subplot(3, 1, 1)
stem(nx1, x1), axis([0, 9, ylim])
xlabel('nx1'); 
ylabel('Output')
subplot(3, 1, 2), stem(nh1, h1), axis([0, 9, ylim])
xlabel('nh1'); ylabel('Output')
subplot(3, 1, 3), stem(nh1, h2), axis([0, 9, ylim])
xlabel('nh2'); ylabel('Output')

```

----------------------------------------------------------------

### Basic Problem b

The outputs are the same.

We first find convolved x1 with h1, which is `x1[n] * h1[n]`, then we change `x1[n]` into the impulse response and `h1[n]` into the input, and make convolution again, which is `x1[n] * h1[n]`.

The plots for them are shown below, and we can easily figure out that `x1[n] * h1[n]` equals to `x1[n] * h1[n]`.

![Figure 2.4_b](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamuelHuang2019/SigSys-lab/master/figures/A2_2-4_b.png)

The MATLAB script is shown below.

```matlab
nx1 = 0:9;
nh1 = 0:4;
x1 = [ones(1,5) zeros(1,5)];
h1 = [1 -1 3 0 1];
h2 = [0 2 5 4 -1];

nw = 0:13;
w1 = conv(x1,h1);
w2 = conv(h1,x1);


subplot(2,1,1),stem(nw,w1),axis([0,13,ylim])
xlabel('nw');ylabel('Output');title('w1[n]=x1[n]*h1[n]')
subplot(2,1,2),stem(nw,w1),axis([0,13,ylim])
xlabel('nw');ylabel('Output');title('w1[n]=h1[n]*x1[n]')

```

----------------------------------------------------------------

### Basic Problem c

The two methods give the same results.

We first convolved `x1[n]*h1[n]` and `x1[n]*h2[n]` separately, and then add them together and find out the plot. After that, we try to add `h1[n]` and `h2[n]` first, and convolved `x1[n]*(h1[n]+h2[n])`.

![Figure 2.4_b](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamuelHuang2019/SigSys-lab/master/figures/A2_2-4_c.png)

The two plots are shown above, and we can see that they are exactly the same, which means they have the same results.

The MATLAB script is shown below.

```matlab
nx1 = 0:9;
nh1 = 0:4;
x1 = [ones(1, 5) zeros(1, 5)];
h1 = [1 -1 3 0 1];
h2 = [0 2 5 4 -1];
h3 = h1 + h2;

nw = 0:13;
w1 = conv(x1, h1) + conv(x1, h2);
w2 = conv(x1, h3);

subplot(2, 1, 1), stem(nw, w1), axis([0, 13, ylim])
xlabel('n_w'); ylabel('w_1')
title('w_1[n] = x_1[n] * h_1[n] + x_1[n] * h_2[n]')
subplot(2, 1, 2)
stem(nw, w2)
axis([0, 13, ylim])
xlabel('n_w')
ylabel('w_2')
title('w_2[n] = x_1[n] * (h_1[n] + h_2[n])')
```

----------------------------------------------------------------

### Basic Problem d

Compairing $y_{d1}[n]$ and $y_{d2}[n]$ ,we have the same results.

First we calculate `x1[n]* h1[n]` and then we use this result to convolved with `h2[n]`.Next we calculate the `h1[n]* h2[n]` firstly and then use the output as the impulse response to convolved with `x1[n]`.

![Figure 2.4_b](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamuelHuang2019/SigSys-lab/master/figures/A2_2-4_d.png)

The two plots are shown above, it can be apparently concluded that the output are the same.

The MATLAB script is shown below.

```matlab
nx1 = 0:9;
nh1 = 0:4;
x1 = [ones(1,5) zeros(1,5)];
h1 = [1 -1 3 0 1];
h2 = [0 2 5 4 -1];

nw = 0:13;

h3 = conv(x1, h1);
h4 = conv(h1, h2);

w1 = conv(h3,h2);
nw1 = 0:17;
w2 = conv(x1,h4);
nw2 = 0:17;

subplot(2,1,1),stem(nw1,w1),axis([0,17,ylim])
xlabel('nw1');ylabel('(x1[n]*h1[n]])*h2[n]');
subplot(2,1,2),stem(nw2,w2),axis([0,17,ylim])
xlabel('nw2');ylabel('x1[n]*(h1[n]*h2[n])');
```

----------------------------------------------------------------

### Intermediate Problem e

For this question, we convolved $x_1[n]*h_{e1}[n]$ and $x_2[n]*h_{e}2[n]$, where $h_{e1}[n]$ and $h_{e2}[n]$ have the relationship $h_{e2}[n] = hg_{e1}[n-n_0]$.

The two plots are shown below.

![Figure 2.4_b](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamuelHuang2019/SigSys-lab/master/figures/A2_2-4_e.png)

We can easily conclude from the plots that $y_{e2}[n] = y_{e1}[n-n_0]$.

The MATLAB script is shown below.

```matlab
nx1 = 0:9;
nh1 = 0:4;
nh2 = 2:6;
x1 = [ones(1,5) zeros(1,5)];
h1 = [1 -1 3 0 1];
h2 = h1;

ny1 = nx1(1)+nh1(1):nx1(end)+nh1(end);
ny2 = nx1(1)+nh2(1):nx1(end)+nh2(end);
y1 = conv(x1,h1);
y2 = conv(x1,h2);

subplot(2,1,1),stem(ny1,y1),axis([0,15,ylim])
xlabel('n');ylabel('ye1 = x1[n]*he1[n]');title('ye1');
subplot(2,1,2),stem(ny2,y2),axis([0,15,ylim])
xlabel('n');ylabel('ye2 = x1[n]*he2[n]');title('ye2');
```

----------------------------------------------------------------

### Intermediate Problem f

To finds out the two outputs, we should first figure out the output of system 1, which is $(n+1).*x_1[n]$. Then we use the output as the input of System 2, and use $h_{f2}[n]$ as the impulse response to get the output $y_{f1}[n]$.

Another try is that we first convolved $h_{f1}[n]$ with $h_{f2}[n]$, then we use the result as the impulse response to convolved with $x_1[n]$, the convolution result is named as $y_{f2}[n]$.

![Figure 2.4_b](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamuelHuang2019/SigSys-lab/master/figures/A2_2-4_f.png)

We can easily conclude from the plots that they are not equal to each other.

The MATLAB script is shown below.

```matlab
nx1 = 0:9;
nhf2 = 0:4;
x1 = [ones(1, 5) zeros(1, 5)];
hf2 = [1 -1 3 0 1];

w = (nx1 + 1) .* x1;

yf1 = conv(w, hf2);
nyf1 = nx1(1) + nhf2(1):nx1(end) + nhf2(end);

xf1 = [1 zeros(1, 4)];
hf1 = (nhf2 + 1) .* xf1;

hseries = conv(hf1, hf2);
nhseries = nhf2(1) + nhf2(1):nhf2(end) + nhf2(end);

yf2 = conv(x1, hseries);
nyf2 = nx1(1) + nhseries(1):nx1(end) + nhseries(end);

subplot(2, 1, 1), stem(nyf1, yf1), axis([0, 17, ylim])
xlabel('n'); ylabel('yf1 = w[n]*hf2[n]'); title('yf1');
subplot(2, 1, 2), stem(nyf2, yf2), axis([0, 17, ylim])
xlabel('n'); ylabel('yf2 = x1[n]*(hf1[n]*hf2[n]'); title('yf2');
```

----------------------------------------------------------------

### Intermediate Problem g

To find out the two output signals, we first need to find out the signal $x_g[n]$, and then use this signal as input signal for System 1 to find out the output signal $y_{ga}[n]$.Then we use the output of System 1 as the input signal for System 2. And the output $y_{gb}[n]$ is the convolution of $y_{ga}[n]$ and $h_{g2}[n]$.$y_{g1}[n]$ is the result of add $y_{ga}[n]$ and $y_{gb}[n]$ together, which is `yg1 = yga + ygb`.

For another try, we first figure out the unit impulse response for System 1 by letting the input signal be unit impulse signal. Then we add this response signal $h_{g1}[n]$  with $h_{g2}[n]$. After that we convolved $x_g[n]$ with this result, so now we get the $y_{g2}[n]$ which is `yg2 = xg * (hg1 + hg2)`.

The two plots for $y_{g1}[n]$ and $y_{g2}[n]$ are shown below.

![Figure 2.4_b](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamuelHuang2019/SigSys-lab/master/figures/A2_2-4_g.png)

It is obvious that they are the same, which means $y_{g1}[n] = y_{g2}[n]$.

The MATLAB script is shown below.

```matlab
n = 0:4;
x = [1 zeros(1,4)];
hg2 = [0 2 5 4 -1];
xg = 2.*x;

yga = xg.^2;
ygb = conv(xg,hg2);
nygb = 0:8;
yg1 = [yga zeros(1,4)] + ygb;
nyg1 = 0:8;

hg1 = x.^2;
hparallel = hg1 + hg2;
yg2 = conv(xg,hparallel);
nyg2 = 0:8;

subplot(2,1,1),stem(nyg1,yg1),axis([0,8,ylim])
xlabel('n');ylabel('yg1 = xg*hga + xg*hgb');title('yg1');
subplot(2,1,2),stem(nyg2,yg2),axis([0,8,ylim])
xlabel('n');ylabel('yf2 = xg*(hg1 + hg2)');title('yg2');
```

## 2.5

### Basic Problem a

Basic problems a,b,c use the same Systems, so first we plot the Systems' outputs.

For System 1, it is not easy to figure out the expression for y using x quickly, so use vector to record their index and count the result using `filter`.

The plot is shown below.

![Figure 2.4_b](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamuelHuang2019/SigSys-lab/master/figures/A2_2-5_a.png)

For System2, we simply use `cos()` to fing out the result.

The plot is shown below.

![Figure 2.4_b](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamuelHuang2019/SigSys-lab/master/figures/A2_2-5_a(2).png)

For System 3, we claculated the results using point multiplicaiton, which is `n.*x[n]`.

The plot is shown below.

![Figure 2.5_a](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamuelHuang2019/SigSys-lab/master/figures/A2_2-5_a(3).png)

### Basic Problem b

Since for all three systems the input x3 = x1 + 2*x2, and the output y4 = y1 + 2*y2, so to analyse whether they are linear, we only need to check the plots for y3 and y4. 

It is easy to see that System 1 and System 3 are linear but System 2 is not.

### Basic Problem c

To figure out whether they are time invariant, we need to compare y1 and y2, since the input x1 and x2 have the relation $x_1[n] = x_2[n-n_0]$, so if $y_1[n] = y_2[n-n_0]$, then the system is time invariant.

It is easy to see that System 1 and System 2 are time invariant while System 3 are not.
