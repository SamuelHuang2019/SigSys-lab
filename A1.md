### Basic Problem a

The system $y[n] = \sin((\pi/2)x[n]$ is not linear. Use the signals $x_1[n] = \delta[n]$ and $x_2[n] = 2\delta[n]$ to demonstrate how the system violates linearity.

The MATLAB script is shown in the following code block.

```matlab
% Define scopes
l = 2;

% Basic Problem a
n = [-l : l];
x1 = [zeros(1, l) 1 zeros(1, l)];
x2 = 2*x1;
y1 = sin(pi/2*x1);
y2 = sin(pi/2*x2);

stem(n, y1, 'o')
stem(n, y2, '*')
```

### Basic Problem b

The system $y[n] = x[n] + x[n + 1]$ is not causal. Use the signal $x[n] = u[n]$ to demonstrate this. Define the MATLAB vectors x and y to represent the input on the interval $-5 \le n \le 9$, and the output on the interval $-6 \le n \le 9$, respectively.

The MATLAB script is shown in the following code block.

```matlab
%Basic Problem b
n = [-6 : 9];
x = [zeros(1, 6) 1/2 ones(1, 9) ]
x0 = [zeros(1, 6) 1/2 ones(1, 9)];
x1 = [zeros(1, 5) 1/2 ones(1, 10)];
y = x0 + x1;

stem(n, x, '*');
stem(n, y);
```

The excitation starts at time $n=0$, however, before that, at time $n=-1$, the input of $y[n]$ is non-zero. Hence, the system is not causal.

### Intermediate Problem c

The MATLAB script is shown in the following code block.

```matlab
n = [-1 : 0.001 : 1];
x = n.^2;
y = log(x);
plot(n,y,'*')
```

The system is not stable, because when we give a bounded input the output approaches infinity at time $n = 0$, which contradicts the definition of stability.

### Advanced Problems

For each of the following systems, state whether or not the system is linear, time-invariant, causal, stable, and invertible. For each property you claim the system does not possess, construct a counter-argument using MATLAB to demonstrate how the system violates the property in question.

(e). $y[n] = x^3[n]$

The MATLAB script is shown below.

```matlab
% define scope
l = 5;

%1.4 advanced problem
n = [-l:l];
x1 = n;
x2 = 2 * n;
y1 = x1.^3;
y2 = x2.^3;
y3 = 2 * y1;
stem(n, y1);
hold on
stem(n, y2);
hold on
stem(n, y3);
```

According to the plot, $2x^3[n]\ne(2x[n])^3$, hence the system is nonlinear.
