## Basic Problems

The system $y[n] = \sin((\pi/2)x[n]$ is not linear. Use the signals $x_1[n] = \delta[n]$ and $x_2[n] = 2\delta[n]$ to demonstrate how the system violates linearity.

The MATLAB script is shown in the following code block.

```matlab
% Define scopes
l = 2;

% Basic Problem a
n = [-l : l];
x1 = [zeros(1, l) 1 zeros(1, l)];
x2 = 2*x1;
y1 = sin(pi/2*x1);
y2 = sin(pi/2*x2);
stem(n, y1, 'o')
hold on
stem(n, y2, '*')
title('y[n] = sin((pi/2)x[n])')
xlabel('Time');
ylabel('y-value')
legend('y(x_1[n])', 'y(x_2[n])');
```

The system $y[n] = x[n] + x[n + 1]$ is not causal. Use the signal $x[n] = u[n]$ to demonstrate this. Define the MATLAB vectors x and y to represent the input on the interval $-5 \le n \le 9$, and the output on the interval $-6 \le n \le 9$, respectively.
